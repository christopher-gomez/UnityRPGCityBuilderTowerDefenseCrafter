# UnityRPGCityBuilderTowerDefenseCrafter

A procedurally generated, 3D Crafting/Survival PC game created for my COMP 565 Advanced Computer Graphics class my senior year at CSUN. 

Game runs on Unity Engine, models made with Blender, scripts written in C#. The player starts in the middle of the forest with nothing but an axe and a bow. The object of the game is to survive the waves of monsters that spawn at night, progressively getting more difficult every night, and expand the town in order to attract villages who will man towers that aid in defense.
